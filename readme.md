# CSS, Animal Style, Using Classes and IDs

Building off what we've done in class, create HTML and CSS documents with the following directory structure:

- `css_lab`
  - `index.html`
  - `styles.css`

Be sure to add a link to the CSS file in the index page, and create a valid HTML document.

###Creating Elements

  - Mouse
  - Canary
  - Penguin

  - Cat
  - Goldfish
  - Dog

  - Tuna
